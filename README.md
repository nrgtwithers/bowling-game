# Bowling Score Card 

Coding Exercise

## Rules of the Bowling:

- _One game_ always consists of **ten frames** only.
- _Each frame_, bowler only has **two rolls**.
- Strike (X): The score is all 10 pins are knocked down during the first roll.
- Spare (/): Is when the bowler knocks down all 10 pins within two rolls.
- Open Frame (Ex: 3,4): Is when the bowler knows down less than 10 pins within the two rolls. 
**Game Score is total of all frame scores**


### Technologies Utilized 

- HTML / HTML5
- CSS / CS3
- Javascript
- jQuery

#### Things to still do

- Add more conditions (For scores equaling up to 10, for final scoring, and etc)
- Add frame totals to each other
- Remove buttons that would exceed 10 to avoid errors (remove alert as well)
- Condense code to be less redundant
- Test & Debug
